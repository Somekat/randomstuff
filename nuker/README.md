# Nuker bot
Let me get this clear, DO NOT USE THIS FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES! This is just something i decided to make for literally no reason, please do not use this to ruin someone's server.

Now that that's out of the way, lets continue.

# Nuker bot setup and usage
Basically, you take a jpeg of the icon for the server, and name it serverico.jpg. Put it in the same directory as the `nuker.py` file. This will change the server icon when you commit murder on it.

How to run

EDIT the `nuker.py` file at the end and add in your bot token, NOT your user token.

`pip3 install discord.py requests`

`python3 nuker.py`

At this point it should show `Let's do some damage`. Now you can run commands.
Here's the commands you probably would use for this:

`b!commitmurder` Commit murder on the server. THIS IS IRREVERSABLE!

And that's pretty much it. As I said, don't use this for malicious purposes!
